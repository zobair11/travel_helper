An AI-powered travel assistant that helps users find hotels through natural language conversation. Built with LangGraph and LangChain, the application uses GPT-4 to understand user travel requests, collects booking details (destination, dates, guests, rooms), and searches hotel availability via the Hotelbeds API. The system features intelligent conversation flow management, geocoding for location resolution, result caching for performance, and automatically ranks hotels by price to display the most affordable options.
